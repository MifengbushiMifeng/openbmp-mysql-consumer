  # In minutes; The maximum age between received collector heartbeats.
  #     The collector sends heatbeat messages every interval.  This

  # Number of writer threads per processing type.
  #     The number of threads and mysql connections are
  #     [types * writer_max_threads_per_type]. Each writer makes
  #     a connection to MySQL in order to execute SQL statements in parallel.
  #     The number of threads are auto-scaled up and down based on partition
  #     load.  If there is high load, additional threads will be added, up
  #     to the writer_max_threads_per_type.
  #
  #  Following types are implemented.
  #   - Default
  #   - as_path_analysis
  #   - base attributes

  # Number of consecutive times the writer queue (per type) can sustain over
  #    the high threshold mark.  If queue is above threshold for a consecutive
  #    writer_allowed_over_queue_times value, a new thread will be added for
  #    the writer type, providing it isn't already at max threads (per type).
  writer_allowed_over_queue_times: 2

  # Number of seconds the writer needs to sustain below the low queue threshold mark
  #     in order to trigger scaling back the number of threads in use.  Only one thread
  #     is scaled back a time.  It can take
  #     [writer_seconds_thread_scale_back * writer_max_threads_per_type - 1] time to scale
  #     back to one 1 (per type).
  writer_seconds_thread_scale_back: 1800

  # By default AS Path indexing is enabled.  This can be very resource intensive to MySQL
  #    and disk.   You can disable updating the MySQL 'as_path_analysis' table if
  #    this analysis is not needed/used.  Disabling this will effect the gen_asn_stats table,
  #    which will also effect anything that uses that table.
